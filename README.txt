1. WHICH FILE TO DOWNLOAD
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  zetarays-2.0-amd64.iso    Intel and AMD PCs. This is the right file for
                            almost every desktop and laptop.
                            4,068,900,864 bytes (4.07 GB)

  zetarays-2.0-arm64.iso    64-bit ARM machines and Apple Silicon Macs
                            (with UTM or QEMU).
                            4,077,314,048 bytes (4.08 GB)

  zetarays-2.0-amd64.ova    Ready-made VirtualBox machine for Intel and AMD
                            PCs. Import it and start it, nothing to install.
                            4,301,484,544 bytes (4.30 GB)

  zetarays-2.0-arm64.ova    Ready-made VirtualBox machine for Apple Silicon
                            Macs (VirtualBox 7.2 or later).
                            4,358,498,304 bytes (4.36 GB)

Use an ISO to install ZETA RAYS on a computer, or to try it from a USB stick
without touching your disk. Use an OVA to try it inside a window, leaving your
computer exactly as it is.

The system starts in English, with a US keyboard layout. The installer lets
you choose your language, keyboard layout and time zone, and the installed
system then uses them everywhere (see "Language and keyboard" in section 6).


2. VERIFY YOUR DOWNLOAD
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Always check that the file arrived intact. The SHA-256 checksum must match
exactly.

  arm64.iso   32ec2d776b88cf5def31a59a44617338aa2f0dd3a894d54c40421d67768b9a50
  arm64.ova   7c45c65d104a65660b6a99298feb8a19af6be0c3fb27a9dd181986d5b7c90f7a
  amd64.iso   0005fce52a06dd6d68522648e35238bf7e6845d892f1f1b8a015388695d41468
  amd64.ova   a5e32a9910efca0cc99d48d5d914940c7a0da921eb5f481b46b7afd10ed93705

The same checksums are in the SHA256SUMS file, next to the images.

How to check:

  Windows (PowerShell)
      Get-FileHash .\zetarays-2.0-amd64.iso -Algorithm SHA256

  macOS (Terminal)
      shasum -a 256 zetarays-2.0-arm64.iso

  Linux (Terminal)
      sha256sum zetarays-2.0-amd64.iso

  All files at once, with SHA256SUMS in the same folder:
      sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS        (Linux)
      shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS    (macOS)

If the checksum does not match, the file is incomplete or corrupted: download
it again. Never install an image that fails verification.


3. PHILOSOPHY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Few things, done well. A black, quiet desktop where every piece belongs to
the same design. An assistant that runs on your own computer, does what you
ask and checks that it really happened before saying "done". Tools for
security work, ready to use. Nothing that phones home, nothing that runs
without a reason, and no feature that only works in a demo.


4. REQUIREMENTS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                 Minimum                       Recommended
  Processor      64-bit (x86-64 or ARM64)      4 cores or more
  Memory         4 GB                          8 GB
  Disk           15 GB free                    20 GB free or more
  Firmware       UEFI or BIOS (amd64)          UEFI with Secure Boot

  Processor    64-bit is required. On a 32-bit processor or virtual machine
               the boot stops with an error.
  Memory       With less than 8 GB the local AI model is not kept in memory
               between questions, so answers are slower. With 16 GB or more
               it is loaded in advance, at login.
  Disk         The installed system takes about 8 GB.
  Firmware     The images use the signed shim: Secure Boot can stay on.
               The amd64 image also boots in BIOS/Legacy mode.


5. TRYING IT AND INSTALLING IT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From a USB stick (ISO)

  1. Write the ISO to a stick of at least 8 GB with Rufus (Windows),
     balenaEtcher (Windows, macOS, Linux) or dd (Linux, macOS).
     The image is hybrid: write it as it is, no conversion needed.
  2. Boot your computer from the stick. The boot menu offers:
       Try ZETA RAYS OS                    the live desktop (starts by itself
                                           after 5 seconds)
       Install ZETA RAYS OS                opens the installer at once
       Try ZETA RAYS OS (safe graphics)    for difficult graphics cards
       Tools                               UEFI firmware settings, check the
                                           boot media
  3. The ZETA RAYS desktop comes up, fully working: you can try it without
     changing anything on your computer.
  4. To install it, choose "Install ZETA RAYS OS" in the welcome window, or
     "Install ZETA RAYS" from the app menu.

The boot menu, the live desktop and the installer start in English, with a
US keyboard layout. The first screen of the installer has a language menu at
the bottom: choose your language there (Italiano, for example) and the rest
of the installation continues in that language. The next screens set your
time zone, regional formats and keyboard layout. The installed system starts
with all of these choices. To change them later, use Settings > Language &
Region.

In VirtualBox (OVA)

  1. VirtualBox, File > Import Appliance, pick the .ova file.
  2. Start the machine. It logs in automatically.
  The machine comes preset with 8 GB of memory and 4 processors.

In VirtualBox (ISO)

  When you create the machine, choose Type "Linux" and a 64-bit version.
  If you leave a 32-bit version, the boot stops with an error about the
  program format (i686 / x86-64). That is not a fault in the image: it is the
  virtual machine set to 32-bit.

Alongside another system (dual boot)

  ZETA RAYS can be installed next to Kali Linux, another distribution or
  Windows. Its boot menu looks for the other systems and lists them, with five
  seconds to choose. It installs into its own EFI folder, /EFI/zetarays, so it
  never overwrites another system's boot files. Secure Boot keeps working
  after installation: you do not need to turn it off.

  Manual partitioning next to another system, step by step:

    1. Leave the other system's EFI partition alone: the small one (100 to
       500 MB), FAT32, with the "boot" / "esp" flags. Do not delete it and do
       not format it. Do not add other flags (not "bios_grub").
    2. Select the partition meant for ZETA RAYS, Edit: tick Format, file
       system ext4, mount point "/", no flags.
    3. Select the existing EFI partition, Edit: mount point "/boot/efi",
       and leave Format UNTICKED. This is the step people miss: without it
       there is nowhere to put the boot loader.
    4. Swap is optional. An existing swap partition can be shared with the
       other system: mount point "swap", without formatting.
    5. Only on older computers started in BIOS (Legacy) mode, there is a
       "Boot loader location" field at the bottom: leave the whole disk
       selected (for example /dev/sda), not a single partition.

  Before pressing Install, the summary must show "Format" only once, on the
  ZETA RAYS partition.

  If step 3 is skipped, the installer warns "No EFI system partition
  configured": go back and do step 3. If you continue anyway, the installer
  stops at the end and says so, instead of finishing "successfully" and
  leaving a machine that cannot boot.

  If you format a partition that the other system used as swap, that system
  may wait about a minute and a half for it at boot. To fix it, start the
  other system and remove the swap line from its /etc/fstab.

Logging in

  User        zeta
  Password    zeta

The computer is named zetarays, so the terminal shows zeta@zetarays. The OVAs
log in automatically. When you install, you choose your own user name and
password.


6. WHAT IS INSIDE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A complete desktop, written for ZETA RAYS: bar, Dock, app launcher, Control
Center, Files, Terminal, Monitor, Security, Settings, file search. Technical
base: Debian 13 (trixie), Linux kernel 6.12.111, Hyprland 0.55 with the
official fix for a crash with open menus.

Security and analysis tools, for professional and educational use, with a
Security app that lists them and installs the missing ones.

144 file types have a program that opens them, and every one of those programs
is actually installed: PDF, EPUB, images (including WEBP, HEIC, AVIF), video,
audio, archives, fonts, text and code.

Language and keyboard
  The USB stick and the live session start in English, with the US
  keyboard layout. The installer asks for your language, keyboard layout
  and time zone, and the installed system uses them everywhere: login
  screen, desktop, apps and terminal.
  Settings > Language & Region changes them later: the language, the
  regional formats (dates, times, numbers, currency), the keyboards (see
  "Keyboards" below) and an input method for Chinese, Japanese and Korean
  (Fcitx 5: Mozc for Japanese, Pinyin for Simplified Chinese, Chewing for
  Traditional Chinese, Hangul for Korean; Ctrl + Space switches between
  the keyboard and the input method). A new language applies after you
  log out and back in; keyboards apply at once.
  Languages: English (United States and United Kingdom), Italian, French,
  German, Spanish, Portuguese (Portugal and Brazil), Dutch, Polish,
  Russian, Ukrainian, Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, Romanian, Bulgarian, Greek,
  Turkish, Swedish, Norwegian Bokmal, Danish, Finnish, Croatian, Slovenian,
  Serbian, Hebrew, Arabic, Persian, Hindi, Bengali, Japanese, Korean,
  Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese.
  The ZETA RAYS apps themselves (desktop, bar, Settings, ZETA and the
  other ZETA RAYS tools) are translated into English and Italian. With any
  other language, the system, Firefox, Thunderbird, the installer and the
  GTK and Qt apps use that language, while the ZETA RAYS apps stay in
  English. Fonts for all these scripts are included, and text recognition
  (OCR) reads the system language.

Keyboards
  Settings > Language & Region > Keyboards holds up to four layouts (for
  example Italian, English US and English UK). The first one is the
  default; Alt + Shift or a click on the indicator in the bar (IT, US,
  GB...) switches between them, and changes apply at once.

Fonts
  Settings > Fonts shows every font of the computer in its own typeface,
  with a sample text you can change and a search. "Add Fonts..." (or
  dropping .ttf, .otf, .ttc or .woff files on the page) installs new fonts
  for your user, ready at once in every app; fonts you added can be removed
  (they go to the Trash).

Account
  Settings > Account shows your name and user and lets you choose your
  picture: a .jpg or .png photo (cut to a circle from the centre, sharp at
  every size) or a plain circle in one of the four system colors (blue,
  red, green, white). By default the circle has the accent color and
  changes with it. It appears in the account and power menu (click it to
  open Settings > Account), on the lock screen and at login.

Displays
  Settings > Displays lists every connected display: resolution (the
  native one is marked), refresh rate, scale (only the values that fit
  the resolution and leave a usable desktop), orientation, and for a
  built-in laptop panel the brightness. With two or more displays: drag
  them on the map to match your desk, join them, mirror them or use only
  one, and choose the main display (the first workspace opens there).
  "Identify Displays" shows each number on its screen. Nothing changes
  until Apply; then the real state is checked and a dialog asks to keep
  the new settings: without an answer the previous ones come back after
  15 seconds. Kept settings are remembered for each display (make, model
  and serial number), also when it is unplugged and plugged in again.
  zeta-schermi list prints the state in a terminal.

Windows always within reach
  A window can never stay where you cannot grab it: if a program moves its
  window off the screen or opens it larger than the screen, or a display
  is unplugged or its resolution or scale changes, the window comes back
  with its title bar and buttons inside the screen, above the bar.
  SUPER + SHIFT + W (or zeta-finestre recupera) brings every window back
  at once. Menus of the bar always open inside the screen.

Instant menus
  The menus of the bar (the ZETA RAYS logo, search, network, sound, clock,
  power) stay ready in memory: a click opens them at once, with fresh data,
  and a second click or Esc closes them. Each shows only its own things:
  the network icon Wi-Fi, available networks, Ethernet, Internet status,
  VPN and Network Settings; the sound icon volume, output devices,
  microphone, input devices and Sound Settings; the clock and the battery
  the Control Center (quick toggles, brightness, battery). There is always
  exactly one bar: if Waybar ever duplicates it (after the screen wakes up
  or a monitor is reconnected), the extra copies are removed within
  seconds.

Firefox start page
  With internet, Firefox opens zetarays.org. Without internet it opens a copy
  of the same site stored on the computer (links disabled), never an error
  page. You can choose another start page in Firefox's settings.

Look and feel
  Light and dark theme, with SUPER + T or from the Control Center. An accent
  color of your choice, which retints the bar, borders, launcher, wallpaper
  and terminal together. The default wallpaper is the ZETA RAYS logo in the
  accent color. Eight ZETA RAYS wallpapers (blue waves, green circuits, red
  waves, terminal, and the logo in blue, green, red and white) are one click
  away in Settings > Appearance > Wallpaper. The lock screen is always
  plain black, on every display, also when waking from sleep (sleep waits
  until the lock is on screen); the wallpaper comes back after unlocking.
  The text editor can have a white or a black page (Settings > Appearance
  > Text Editor) while its window follows the theme of the desktop.

Desktop
  Arrange the icons your way: Home and Trash move like every other icon.
  Right-click the Desktop > View: "Align to Grid" (on by default) or free
  placement anywhere, icons arranged from the left (like Windows) or from
  the right (like macOS), small, medium or large icons. "Clean Up Icons"
  snaps them to the nearest free cells keeping your layout; "Sort By" puts
  them in order. Drag a program (an AppImage, or an entry of the app menu)
  from Files onto the Desktop and it becomes a shortcut, never a copy of
  the program; New > App Shortcut... lists every app, AppImages included.
  Programs unpacked by hand (Blender from blender.org in /opt or in
  Downloads): their desktop entry or the program itself dropped on the
  Desktop becomes a working shortcut with full paths, which can be moved,
  copied and pasted freely; programs in /opt appear in the app menu by
  themselves. Blender from blender.org starts like the packaged one, at the
  right size for your screen.
  Thumbnails of images, SVG, PDF and video on the Desktop and in Files. Drop
  an image or a file from Firefox or Chromium onto the Desktop and it is
  saved there as a real file, with its original name; a link becomes a
  shortcut to the page. A file with the same name is never overwritten.
  Minimized windows appear in the bar as live previews. The Dock can be
  reordered in Settings > Dock and keeps its order after a restart.

Text out of pictures (OCR, done on your computer)
  SUPER + SHIFT + T and drag over any part of the screen: the text goes
  straight to the clipboard. For files, right-click an image or a PDF and
  choose "Copy Text from Image". Text is read in the system language and
  in English.

Never stuck
  Ctrl + Alt + Esc turns the pointer into a red crosshair: click the window
  that stopped responding and it is closed with every process it started,
  first politely, then by force. Ctrl + Shift + Esc closes the active window.
  Ctrl + Alt + Delete opens the emergency panel: task manager, terminal,
  restore the desktop, lock, log out, restart, shut down. When memory is about
  to run out, the heaviest program is closed before the computer freezes, and
  a notification says which one. If the desktop ever crashes, it comes back by
  itself in a few seconds, with your settings.

ZETA Share
  Send files to phones and computers nearby (Android, iPhone, Windows, macOS,
  Linux) with LocalSend: right-click a file in Files and choose "Share with
  ZETA Share". Files go directly over the local network, never through the
  internet.

Apps
  Firefox, Thunderbird, a text editor, a media player, an image viewer, a PDF
  viewer, a terminal with tabs, splits, bash, zsh and fish. Settings > Default
  Apps chooses the default for each role, and every program follows the
  choice.

Printers
  Settings > Printers finds Wi-Fi, wired and USB printers by itself and adds
  them with one click, without drivers (IPP Everywhere) or with the right
  driver (HP, Epson, Brother, Gutenprint for older Canon and others). There
  is a "Test page" button, and a printer can also be added by its IP
  address.

Search
  The magnifying glass in the bar finds apps, settings, your files and the
  text inside your documents. Your own files come first, even ones you
  created a second ago, each with the icon of its type; then external
  disks, /opt and /etc. Internal system files are left out.

Files and system folders
  In Files, right-click inside a system folder such as /opt: "Paste Here as
  Administrator" pastes the copied files after asking for your password,
  "Open as Administrator" opens the folder with full rights. "Send To >
  Desktop (Create Link)" puts a working shortcut to any program on the
  Desktop.

Installing and managing programs
  Right-click any app in the app menu or in search: open it, open its file
  location, add it to the Desktop or the Dock, "Get info" (where it comes
  from: APT, Flatpak, AppImage, /opt; its version and paths), remove it from
  the menu or uninstall it. System apps cannot be removed by mistake.
  Double-click a .deb file or a .flatpakref (the "Install" button on
  flathub.org) to install it. AppImages placed in ~/Applications (or found
  in Downloads, on the Desktop, in ~/.local/bin or in /opt) join the menu by
  themselves, with their own name and icon; the Italian folders of earlier
  installations (Applicazioni, Scaricati, Scrivania) still work. An AppImage
  keeps the same identity when you move, rename or update the file: one
  menu entry, one Desktop icon, and the Desktop shortcuts and the Dock
  follow the file. An AppImage file on the Desktop shows its app's name and
  icon. "Change icon..." gives an app a new icon everywhere (menu, Dock,
  search, Desktop); "Restore icon" puts the original back.

Where is a program?
  In the terminal, zeta-app find NAME (or zeta-app trova NAME) tells where a
  program is and how to start it: every installation (APT, Flatpak,
  AppImage, /opt...), the launch command, the executable, the desktop
  entry, the package and its version, and whether a command is in your PATH
  (and which one runs when you type its name). It also lists system
  services with that name. --json gives the same answer for scripts.
  zeta-app --help lists the other commands: launch, info, locate, desktop,
  dock, undock, set-icon, reset-icon, hide, show, hidden, uninstall,
  install, appimage, maintenance and list (the earlier Italian names still
  work in scripts).

Servers and shared folders
  "Connect to Server" (app menu, search, or "Connect to a server" in
  Settings > Wi-Fi & Network) opens shared folders of Windows PCs, Macs and
  NAS drives (SMB), SSH servers (SFTP), FTP, WebDAV (Nextcloud), NFS and
  older Macs (AFP). Servers on the local network are listed by themselves.
  Favorites also appear in Files, and the password can be remembered.

Terminal tools
  ip, ifconfig, route, ss, ping, traceroute, tracepath, mtr, dig, host,
  nslookup, ethtool, iw, nmcli, rfkill, nc (netcat), socat, telnet, ssh,
  scp, sftp, sshfs, autossh, ssh-import-id, curl, wget, git and python3 all
  work for the normal user. With sudo: nft, iptables and ip6tables
  (nftables backend), ufw, conntrack, tcpdump, nmap, arp.


7. ZETA, THE AI
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ZETA is the assistant of ZETA RAYS. Open it from the Dock, or from the
launcher (SUPER + SPACE, then ZETA). You can write or speak to it, in
English or in Italian, whatever the system language.

What it does
  It really drives the system: 58 actions on apps, windows, files and
  folders, settings, volume, brightness, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, the Dock,
  processes and software. After every action it checks the real state of
  the system, and it only says "done" when the check agrees. Deleting,
  installing or removing software, restarting and shutting down always ask
  for your consent first, showing exactly what will be touched. "Close"
  asks the app to close, so it can ask you to save; only "force close" ends
  it, and asks first. ZETA never gets free root access and cannot run
  arbitrary commands. Every action is written to
  ~/.local/share/zeta/actions.log, with passwords hidden.

Some things to say or type
  open firefox                         close firefox
  open downloads                       find the file invoice
  create a folder trips on the desktop and then open it
  move note.txt to documents           delete note.txt from the desktop
  how much ram am i using              which processes are using the most cpu
  set the volume to 60%                brightness to 50%
  connect to the wifi network HomeNet  turn off wifi
  set the wallpaper to red waves       light theme
  open sound settings                  lock the computer
  The same requests work in Italian ("apri firefox", "spegni il wifi").

Finding programs
  ZETA also answers questions about the software on the computer:
  "where is blender?", "which command launches firefox?", "which package
  provides git?", "find my appimages". The answer comes from the same
  search as zeta-app find. When the same app is installed more than once
  (for example from APT and from Flatpak), ZETA lists the installations and
  asks which one you mean: "open blender flatpak".

Voice
  ZETA can read its answers aloud with a natural voice (Piper, on your
  computer: Paola in Italian, Lessac in English; other languages use
  espeak-ng) and understand spoken commands (Vosk, Italian and English,
  also on your computer). Nothing you say or hear leaves the computer.

Local AI: Ollama
  By default ZETA uses Ollama with the Llama 3.2 model (1B), included in the
  image and running on your computer: no account, no internet, nothing sent
  anywhere. Simple commands are understood in a fraction of a second without
  the model; the model answers questions and free-form requests. The model
  is loaded into memory when you open ZETA (at login on machines with 16 GB
  or more) and released when not needed, so it does not use memory while
  you are not using it. Settings > AI manages the local models.

Online AI (optional)
  Settings > AI also connects ZETA to Claude, OpenAI (ChatGPT), Gemini,
  DeepSeek, Qwen, Perplexity, Mistral, Groq, xAI Grok or OpenRouter, or to any
  OpenAI-compatible service, including one on your own computer (LM Studio,
  vLLM, llama.cpp). You bring your own key: none is included. Each service
  has a key field, a model field and a "Test" button that really tests the
  connection. Keys are stored encrypted, in the system keyring that your
  login unlocks or, where no keyring is running, as systemd credentials
  bound to this computer: only your user can read them, and they never
  appear in logs or in web addresses. If the chosen service is not ready,
  ZETA uses Ollama.
  Each service starts with a fast, current model (checked on 7 October
  2026: Claude Haiku 5.5, Gemini 3.8 Flash, GPT-6 Luna, DeepSeek Flash, Qwen
  3.8 Flash, gpt-oss on Groq...). Models change often: if one disappears,
  ZETA asks the service for its list and picks another one by itself, and
  requests adapt to what each model accepts.

  Each service starts with its fast model (Claude Haiku 4.5, Gemini 2.5
  Flash, GPT-5 mini, Mistral Small, Sonar, Qwen Plus...); you can pick
  another one. If the default model no longer exists, ZETA asks the service
  for its list of models, picks a fast one and remembers it. If the service
  cannot be reached, the local model answers instead, and ZETA says so.

You always know what is happening
  Under the sphere, ZETA shows which AI and which model are answering, for
  example "Ollama . llama3.2:1b . local". While it works it says whether it
  is loading the model, contacting the online service or carrying out a
  command. Errors give the real reason in plain words: invalid key, service
  not reachable, model not found, too many requests, no internet.


8. NETWORK AND WI-FI
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ethernet works as soon as the cable is in (DHCP, IPv4 and IPv6). Wi-Fi is in
Settings > Wi-Fi & Network, in the Control Center, and through ZETA.

  Security      WPA2, WPA3 and mixed WPA2/WPA3 networks (including WPA3 with
                the newer "hash-to-element" method), open networks.
  Bands         2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.
  Hidden        "Hidden network" in Settings: type the name and the password.
  Passwords     Spaces, symbols and accented letters are fine.
  Region        The radio region is taken from the time zone you chose
                (Europe/Rome gives IT), so every channel allowed in your
                country, such as 12 and 13 on 2.4 GHz, can be used.

Wrong password? ZETA RAYS says "Wrong password" only when the router has
really refused it, and asks for it again at once: you are never stuck with a
wrong password saved. If the connection fails for another reason (weak
signal, a router that does not answer) it says so instead. A saved network
whose password has changed can get the new one with the key button (Change
password), or be forgotten with the bin button (Forget network).

Also in Settings > Wi-Fi & Network: manual IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, DNS, VPN
import (WireGuard, OpenVPN) and proxy.

Remote access (SSH)
  The SSH client and server are installed (with scp, sftp, sshfs, autossh,
  ssh-import-id and netcat).
    Installed system   the server is ON, reachable from your local network
                       and from the internet (if your router forwards port
                       22), with the password you chose while installing.
    Live and OVA       the server is OFF, because they use the well-known
                       password "zeta".
  Turn it on or off in Settings > Wi-Fi & Network > Remote access, or in the
  terminal:
      sudo zeta-ssh on                local network only
      sudo zeta-ssh remote on         also from the internet
      sudo zeta-ssh remote off        back to the local network only
      sudo zeta-ssh off               off
      zeta-ssh status / zeta-ssh config / sudo zeta-ssh diagnose
  (The Italian names of earlier versions, such as "attiva", still work.)
  The choice stays after a restart and after a reload of the firewall, and
  repeating a command never adds duplicate rules: the zeta-ssh-sincronizza
  service puts it back into the firewall sets after every start and every
  firewall reload (sudo zeta-ssh sync does the same by hand). From another
  computer on the same network:  ssh yourname@<address shown by zeta-ssh
  status>

  From the internet: on by default on an installed system, off in the live
  session and the OVAs (their password is known). Use the "Also from the
  internet" switch, or sudo zeta-ssh remote on / remote off.
  Check it with: sudo nft list set inet zeta accesso_remoto
  (elements = { 22 }). Your router must also forward port 22 to this
  computer. Protections: root cannot log in, 4 attempts per connection, and
  more than 10 new connections a minute from the same address are dropped.
  A key is safer than a password: ssh-copy-id yourname@<address>. Passwords
  stay accepted until you decide otherwise, so you cannot lock yourself
  out. The server keys are created on first start, unique to each
  computer.

Firewall: on by default, nftables, table "inet zeta". Every incoming
service is in one of three classes:
  LAN ONLY        local network only: name discovery (mDNS), ZETA Share,
                  SSH when turned on
  REMOTE ENABLED  also from the internet: SSH (on by default once
                  installed, off in the live session and the OVAs)
  DISABLED        everything else, dropped
Replies to connections you started, ping, DHCP and IPv6 always work.
Refused SSH attempts are logged (at most 3 a minute):
journalctl -k -g zeta-fw. Diagnosis of the whole path, from the network
card to sshd: sudo zeta-ssh diagnose. Do not add rules with "nft add rule":
they are lost at the next restart. Extra rules go in a .nft file in
/etc/nftables.d/.

How the network is organized: one active firewall (nftables, table "inet
zeta", saved in /etc/nftables.conf) and one network manager (NetworkManager,
which also writes the DNS servers in /etc/resolv.conf). There is no
firewalld and no systemd-resolved. The iptables command is there, but it
writes into the same nftables. Instead of resolvectl: nmcli dev show (DNS in
use) and cat /etc/resolv.conf.

ufw is installed but OFF. If you prefer it, sudo ufw enable turns it on: it
then filters together with the ZETA firewall, and its rules for SSH (written
by zeta-ssh) and ZETA Share (local network only) are already there, so
nothing is cut off. sudo ufw status shows them.


9. TROUBLESHOOTING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wi-Fi says "Wrong password" but you are sure it is right
  Check upper and lower case and the keyboard layout: the live session uses
  the US layout, an installed system the one you chose (Settings > Language
  & Region). If it still fails, forget the network (bin button) and connect
  again. The full report: sudo zeta-diagnosi.

Wi-Fi says "Could not join" the network
  The router did not complete the connection: move closer, or restart the
  router. If the network is hidden, use "Hidden network".

No Wi-Fi at all
  Settings > Wi-Fi & Network must show the Wi-Fi switch. If it does not, the
  card is not recognized: run "rfkill list" in the terminal (a "Hard
  blocked: yes" means a physical switch or a key on the laptop) and sudo
  zeta-diagnosi.

The first answer of ZETA is slow
  The local model is being loaded into memory, which takes a few seconds the
  first time; ZETA says so while it happens. With less than 8 GB of memory it
  is loaded again each time.

A program does not respond
  Ctrl + Alt + Esc, then click its window. Or Ctrl + Alt + Delete.

"grub rescue>" or the other system is missing from the boot menu
  Start from the ZETA RAYS USB stick, open the terminal and run:
      sudo zeta-ripara-avvio
  It finds the installed systems, shows what it is about to do, asks for
  confirmation, then reinstalls the boot loader and rebuilds the menu. It
  never touches partitions or data. It also fixes installations made with
  earlier test images, which hid the boot menu.

Cannot connect with SSH from another computer
  Run zeta-ssh status: it says whether the server is on, whether port 22 is
  open and which address to use (it can change, for example when you move
  from the cable to Wi-Fi: the router must forward port 22 to the address
  shown now). sudo zeta-ssh diagnose checks everything: network cards,
  routes, the chain SSH_REMOTE_ACCESS > accesso_remoto > nftables > sshd
  line by line, other firewalls (iptables, ufw), sshd, open connections and
  refused attempts.
  From the internet: on this computer run sudo tcpdump -ni any 'tcp port 22'
  and connect from outside. If nothing arrives, the router does not forward
  port 22. If only [S] arrives and no [S.] goes out, access from the
  internet is off (sudo zeta-ssh remote on). In the live session and
  the OVAs the server is off: sudo zeta-ssh on. On the local network,
  from the other computer, nc -vz <address> 22 tells whether the port
  answers. A system installed with an earlier test image can be brought up
  to date with the script aggiorna-rete-zeta-rays.sh released with these
  images: sudo bash aggiorna-rete-zeta-rays.sh --prova analyzes and checks
  without changing anything; then run it again without --prova. If SSH is
  already open from the internet there, it stays open (--solo-lan closes
  it, --remoto opens it).

Kernel panic at boot in a virtual machine (VMware Fusion, Workstation...)
  Fixed in these images: the boot no longer needs more memory than a small
  virtual machine has. VMware creates Linux machines with only 768 MB:
  give ZETA RAYS at least 4 GB of memory and turn on 3D acceleration
  (Display settings), otherwise the desktop is slow or falls back to the
  installer only.

No sound
  Settings > Sound: choose the right output device.

Anything else
  sudo zeta-diagnosi writes a full report (hardware, drivers, network,
  services, errors) that you can send to info@zetarays.org.


10. KNOWN LIMITATIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - The ZETA RAYS apps are translated into English and Italian only. With
    another system language they stay in English, while the rest of the
    system follows the language you chose.
  - ZETA understands commands in English and Italian, written or spoken.
    The local model can reply in other languages, but commands in other
    languages go through the model and are slower and less reliable.
  - Wi-Fi was tested with WPA2, WPA3 and mixed access points, 2.4 and 5 GHz,
    hidden networks and slow DHCP, using simulated radios. Each real card
    depends on its own driver: a few cards without a free driver (some
    Broadcom models) are not supported.
  - With WPA3, a wrong password and a router that does not answer look the
    same to the system: ZETA RAYS then says that it could not join the
    network, instead of "Wrong password".
  - Suspend, Bluetooth and the microphone depend on the hardware and were
    tested in virtual machines only.
  - The local model (Llama 3.2 1B) is small, so that it runs on modest
    computers: it is good for commands and short answers. For long or complex
    work, connect a bigger local model or an online service in Settings > AI.
  - Online AI services need your own key and a working internet connection.
  - Some images on web pages exist only inside the page ("blob" images):
    Firefox cannot hand them over by dragging. Right-click them and choose
    "Save Image As...".
  - The ZETA Share window shows its own name, LocalSend.

12. PRIVACY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ZETA RAYS collects no data and sends no telemetry. The AI runs on your own
computer and does not send what you write to it over the network, unless you
choose an online AI service in Settings > AI: then what you write to ZETA goes
to that service, and to no one else. The only things that leave your computer
are the ones you ask for: package updates, pages you open in the browser,
searches you start.
