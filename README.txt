1. WHICH FILE TO DOWNLOAD
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  zetarays-1.7-amd64.iso    Intel and AMD PCs. This is the right file for
                            almost every desktop and laptop.
                            3,482,845,184 bytes (3.48 GB)

  zetarays-1.7-arm64.iso    64-bit ARM machines and Apple Silicon Macs
                            (with UTM or QEMU).
                            3,441,524,736 bytes (3.44 GB)

  zetarays-1.7-amd64.ova    Ready-made VirtualBox machine for Intel and AMD
                            PCs. Import it and start it, nothing to install.
                            3,808,797,184 bytes (3.81 GB)

  zetarays-1.7-arm64.ova    Ready-made VirtualBox machine for Apple Silicon

Use an ISO to install ZETA RAYS on a computer, or to try it from a USB stick
without touching your disk. Use an OVA to try it inside a window, leaving your
computer exactly as it is.

The system itself is in Italian. The installer starts in English and lets you
pick any language on its first screen.


2. VERIFY YOUR DOWNLOAD
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Always check that the file arrived intact. The SHA-256 code must match
exactly.

  arm64.iso   ec36e53dfcd2bcd05d6e6b655e255750517dcc0b3a9f5efbbe77df5ac318ffe7
  arm64.ova   bdfbcd0a5e304a6a45a939056ed6d5b092a07ea206a2c9c2501f9464f1aa541b
  amd64.iso   c5fb8b82506ab6f88b7a446efaa7a8bc1b07cf8ccaa8da4c9768bdd17b10e1f3
  amd64.ova   8c4e7a999859dc4c7511b1a2d5090cf03a0881de0bb14da008b347a1ba1fe642

The same codes are in the SHA256SUMS file, next to the images.

How to check:

  Windows (PowerShell)
      Get-FileHash .\zetarays-1.7-amd64.iso -Algorithm SHA256

  macOS (Terminal)
      shasum -a 256 zetarays-1.7-arm64.iso

  Linux (Terminal)
      sha256sum zetarays-1.7-amd64.iso

  All files at once, with SHA256SUMS in the same folder:
      sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS        (Linux)
      shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS    (macOS)

If the code does not match, the file is incomplete or corrupted: download it
again. Never install an image that fails verification.


3. PHILOSOPHY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Few things, done well. A black, quiet desktop where every piece belongs to
the same design. An assistant that runs on your own computer, does what you
ask and checks that it really happened before saying "done". Tools for
security work, ready to use. Nothing that phones home, nothing that runs
without a reason, and no feature that only works in a demo.


4. REQUIREMENTS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                 Minimum                       Recommended
  Processor      64-bit (x86-64 or ARM64)      4 cores or more
  Memory         4 GB                          8 GB
  Disk           15 GB free                    20 GB free or more
  Firmware       UEFI or BIOS (amd64)          UEFI with Secure Boot

  Processor    64-bit is required. On a 32-bit processor or virtual machine
               the boot stops with an error.
  Memory       With less than 8 GB the local AI model is not kept in memory
               between questions, so answers are slower. With 16 GB or more
               it is loaded in advance, at login.
  Disk         The installed system takes about 8 GB.
  Firmware     The images use the signed shim: Secure Boot can stay on.
               The amd64 image also boots in BIOS/Legacy mode.


5. TRYING IT AND INSTALLING IT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From a USB stick (ISO)

  1. Write the ISO to a stick of at least 4 GB with Rufus (Windows),
     balenaEtcher (Windows, macOS, Linux) or dd (Linux, macOS).
     The image is hybrid: write it as it is, no conversion needed.
  2. Boot your computer from the stick. The boot menu is in English:
       Try ZETA RAYS OS                    the live desktop (starts by itself
                                           after 5 seconds)
       Install ZETA RAYS OS                opens the installer at once
       Try ZETA RAYS OS (safe graphics)    for difficult graphics cards
       Tools ...                           UEFI firmware settings, check the
                                           boot media
  3. The ZETA RAYS desktop comes up, fully working: you can try it without
     changing anything on your computer.
  4. To install it, choose "Install ZETA RAYS OS" in the welcome window, or
     "Installa ZETA RAYS" from the application menu.

Everything starts in English, the language anyone can read. The first screen
of the installer has a drop-down menu at the bottom: choose your language
there (Italiano, for example): the rest of the installation is in that
language, and so are the system settings (language, formats) of the
installed system. The ZETA RAYS desktop itself is in Italian.

In VirtualBox (OVA)

  1. VirtualBox, File > Import Appliance, pick the .ova file.
  2. Start the machine. It logs in automatically.
  The machine comes preset with 8 GB of memory and 4 processors.

In VirtualBox (ISO)

  When you create the machine, choose Type "Linux" and a 64-bit version.
  If you leave a 32-bit version, the boot stops with an error about the
  program format (i686 / x86-64). That is not a fault in the image: it is the
  virtual machine set to 32-bit.

Alongside another system (dual boot)

  ZETA RAYS can be installed next to Kali Linux, another distribution or
  Windows. Its boot menu looks for the other systems and lists them, with five
  seconds to choose. It installs into its own EFI folder, /EFI/zetarays, so it
  never overwrites another system's boot files. Secure Boot keeps working
  after installation: you do not need to turn it off.

  Manual partitioning next to another system, step by step:

    1. Leave the other system's EFI partition alone: the small one (100 to
       500 MB), FAT32, with the "boot" / "esp" flags. Do not delete it and do
       not format it. Do not add other flags (not "bios_grub").
    2. Select the partition meant for ZETA RAYS, Edit: tick Format, file
       system ext4, mount point "/", no flags.
    3. Select the existing EFI partition, Edit: mount point "/boot/efi",
       and leave Format UNTICKED. This step is the one people miss: without
       it there is nowhere to put the boot loader.
    4. Swap is optional. An existing swap partition can be shared with the
       other system: mount point "swap", without formatting.
    5. Only on older computers started in BIOS (Legacy) mode there is a
       "Boot loader location" field at the bottom: leave the whole disk
       selected (for example /dev/sda), not a single partition.

  Before pressing Install, the summary must show "Format" only once, on the
  ZETA RAYS partition.

  If step 3 is skipped, the installer warns "No EFI system partition
  configured": go back and do step 3. If you continue anyway, the installer
  stops at the end and says so, instead of finishing "successfully" and
  leaving a machine that cannot boot.

  If you format a partition that the other system used as swap, that system
  may wait about a minute and a half for it at boot. To fix it, start the
  other system and remove the swap line from its /etc/fstab.

Logging in

  User        zeta
  Password    zeta

The computer is named zetarays, so the terminal shows zeta@zetarays. The OVAs
log in automatically. After installing, you choose your own user and password.


6. WHAT IS INSIDE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A complete desktop, written for ZETA RAYS: bar, launcher, control centre, file
manager, terminal, system monitor, security centre, native settings, file
search. Technical base: Debian 13 (trixie), Linux kernel 6.12.111,
Hyprland 0.55 with the official fix for a crash with open menus.

Security and analysis tools, for professional and educational use, with a
Security centre that lists them and installs the missing ones.

144 file types have a program that opens them, and every one of those programs
is actually installed: PDF, EPUB, images (including WEBP, HEIC, AVIF), video,
audio, archives, fonts, text and code.

Instant menus
  The menus of the bar (the ZETA RAYS logo, search, network, sound, clock,
  power) stay ready in memory: a click opens them at once, with fresh data,
  and a second click or Esc closes them. There is always exactly one bar:
  if Waybar ever duplicates it (after the screen wakes up or a monitor is
  reconnected), the extra copies are removed within seconds.

Firefox start page
  With internet, Firefox opens zetarays.org. Without internet it opens a copy
  of the same site stored on the computer (links disabled), never an error
  page. You can choose another start page in Firefox's settings.

Look and feel
  Light and dark theme, with SUPER + T or from the control centre. A colour
  accent of your choice, which retints the bar, borders, launcher, wallpaper
  and terminal together. The default wallpaper is the ZETA RAYS logo in the
  accent colour. Eight ZETA RAYS wallpapers (blue waves, green circuits, red
  waves, terminal, and the logo in blue, green, red and white) are one click
  away in Settings > Aspetto > Sfondo. The lock screen shows the same
  wallpaper as the desktop.

Desktop
  Thumbnails of images, SVG, PDF and video on the desktop and in the file
  manager. Drop an image or a file from Firefox or Chromium onto the desktop
  and it is saved there as a real file, with its original name; a link becomes
  a shortcut to the page. A file with the same name is never overwritten.
  Minimized windows appear in the bar as live previews. The dock can be
  reordered in Settings > Dock and keeps its order after a restart.

Text out of pictures (OCR, done on your computer)
  SUPER + SHIFT + T and drag over any part of the screen: the text goes
  straight to the clipboard. For files, right-click an image or a PDF and
  choose "Copia il testo dell'immagine". Italian and English.

Never stuck
  Ctrl + Alt + Esc turns the pointer into a red crosshair: click the window
  that stopped responding and it is closed with every process it started,
  first politely, then by force. Ctrl + Shift + Esc closes the active window.
  Ctrl + Alt + Delete opens the emergency panel: task manager, terminal,
  restore the desktop, lock, log out, restart, shut down. When memory is about
  to run out, the heaviest program is closed before the computer freezes, and
  a notification says which one. If the desktop ever crashes, it comes back by
  itself in a few seconds, with your settings.

ZETA Share
  Send files to phones and computers nearby (Android, iPhone, Windows, macOS,
  Linux) with LocalSend: right-click a file in Files, "Condividi con ZETA
  Share". Files go directly over the local network, never through the
  internet.

Apps
  Firefox, Thunderbird, a text editor, a media player, an image viewer, a PDF
  viewer, a terminal with tabs, splits, bash, zsh and fish. Settings > App
  predefinite chooses the default for each role, and every program follows the
  choice.

Printers
  Settings > Stampanti finds Wi-Fi, wired and USB printers by itself and adds
  them with one click, without drivers (IPP Everywhere) or with the right
  driver (HP, Epson, Brother, Gutenprint for older Canon and others). There
  is a test page button, and a printer can also be added by its IP address.

Files and system folders
  In Files, right-click inside a system folder such as /opt: "Incolla qui
  come amministratore" pastes the copied files after asking for your
  password, "Apri come amministratore" opens the folder with full rights.
  "Invia a > Scrivania" puts a working link to any program on the desktop.

Terminal tools
  ip, ifconfig, route, ss, ping, traceroute, tracepath, mtr, dig, host,
  nslookup, ethtool, iw, nmcli, rfkill, nc (netcat), socat, telnet, ssh,
  scp, sftp, sshfs, autossh, ssh-import-id, curl, wget, git and python3 all
  work for the normal user. With sudo: nft, iptables and ip6tables
  (nftables backend), ufw, conntrack, tcpdump, nmap, arp.


7. ZETA, THE AI
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ZETA is the assistant of ZETA RAYS. Open it from the dock, or from the
launcher (SUPER + SPACE, then ZETA). You can write or speak to it (Italian;
the microphone also understands English).

What it does
  It really drives the system: 56 actions on apps, windows, files and folders,
  settings, volume, brightness, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, the dock, processes and
  software. After every action it checks the real state of the system, and it
  only says "done" when the check agrees. Deleting, installing or removing
  software, restarting and shutting down always ask for your consent first,
  showing exactly what will be touched. "Close" asks the app to close, so it
  can ask you to save; only "force close" ends it, and asks first. ZETA never
  gets free root access and cannot run arbitrary commands. Every action is
  written to ~/.local/share/zeta/actions.log, with passwords hidden.

Some things to say or type (Italian)
  apri firefox                         chiudi firefox
  apri i download                      cerca il file fattura
  crea una cartella viaggi sulla scrivania e poi aprila
  sposta nota.txt nei documenti        elimina nota.txt dalla scrivania
  quanta ram sto usando                che processi stanno usando piu cpu
  alza il volume al 60%                luminosita al 50%
  connettiti alla rete wifi CasaMia    spegni il wifi
  metti lo sfondo onde rosse           tema chiaro
  apri le impostazioni audio           blocca il computer

Local AI: Ollama
  By default ZETA uses Ollama with the Llama 3.2 model (1B), included in the
  image and running on your computer: no account, no internet, nothing sent
  anywhere. Simple commands are understood in a fraction of a second without
  the model; the model answers questions and free requests. The model is
  loaded into memory when you open ZETA (at login on machines with 16 GB or
  more) and released when not needed, so it does not take memory while you
  are not using it. Settings > AI manages the local models.

Online AI (optional)
  Settings > AI also connects ZETA to Claude, OpenAI (ChatGPT), Gemini,
  DeepSeek, Qwen, Perplexity, Mistral, Groq, xAI Grok or OpenRouter, or to any
  OpenAI-compatible service, including one on your own computer (LM Studio,
  vLLM, llama.cpp). You bring your own key: none is included. Each service
  has a key field, a model field and a "Prova" button that really tests the
  connection. Keys are stored encrypted by the system (systemd credentials):
  only your user, on this computer, can read them, and they never appear in
  logs or in web addresses. If the chosen service is not ready, ZETA uses
  Ollama.

  Each service starts with its fast model (Claude Haiku 4.5, Gemini 2.5
  Flash, GPT-5 mini, Mistral Small, Sonar, Qwen Plus...); you can pick
  another one. If the default model no longer exists, ZETA asks the service
  for its list of models, picks a fast one and remembers it. If the service
  cannot be reached, the local model answers instead, and ZETA says so.
  Errors say the real reason: invalid key, model not found, too many
  requests, no internet.

You always know what is happening
  Under the sphere, ZETA shows which AI and which model are answering, for
  example "Ollama . llama3.2:1b . locale". While it works it says whether it
  is loading the model, contacting the online service or carrying out a
  command. Errors are written in plain words: invalid key, service not
  reachable, model not found, no internet.


8. NETWORK AND WI-FI
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ethernet works as soon as the cable is in (DHCP, IPv4 and IPv6). Wi-Fi is in
Settings > Wi-Fi e rete, in the control centre, and through ZETA.

  Security      WPA2, WPA3 and mixed WPA2/WPA3 networks (including WPA3 with
                the newer "hash-to-element" method), open networks.
  Bands         2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.
  Hidden        "Rete nascosta" in Settings: type the name and the password.
  Passwords     Spaces, symbols and accented letters are fine.
  Region        The radio region is taken from the time zone you chose
                (Europe/Rome gives IT), so every channel allowed in your
                country, such as 12 and 13 on 2.4 GHz, can be used.

Wrong password? ZETA RAYS says "password sbagliata" only when the router has
really refused it, and asks for it again at once: you are never stuck with a
wrong password saved. If the connection fails for another reason (weak
signal, a router that does not answer) it says so instead. A saved network
whose password has changed can get the new one with the key button, or be
forgotten with the bin button.

Also in Settings > Wi-Fi e rete: manual IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, DNS, VPN
import (WireGuard, OpenVPN) and proxy.

Remote access (SSH)
  The SSH client and server are installed (with scp, sftp, sshfs, autossh,
  ssh-import-id and netcat).
    Installed system   the server is ON, reachable from your local network
                       and from the internet (if your router forwards port
                       22), with the password you chose while installing.
    Live and OVA       the server is OFF, because they use the well-known
                       password "zeta".
  Turn it on or off in Settings > Wi-Fi e rete > Accesso remoto, or in the
  terminal:
      sudo zeta-ssh attiva            local network only
      sudo zeta-ssh remoto attiva     also from the internet
      sudo zeta-ssh remoto disattiva  back to the local network only
      sudo zeta-ssh disattiva         off
      zeta-ssh stato / zeta-ssh config / sudo zeta-ssh diagnosi
  The choice stays after a restart and after a reload of the firewall, and
  repeating a command never adds duplicate rules. From another computer on
  the same network:  ssh yourname@<address shown by zeta-ssh stato>

  From the internet: on by default on an installed system, off in the live
  session and the OVAs (their password is known). Switch "Anche da
  internet", or sudo zeta-ssh remoto attiva / remoto disattiva. Check it
  with: sudo nft list set inet zeta accesso_remoto (elements = { 22 }).
  Your router must also forward port 22 to this computer. Protections:
  root cannot log in, 4 attempts per connection, and more than 10 new
  connections a minute from the same address are dropped.
  A key is safer than a password: ssh-copy-id yourname@<address>. Passwords
  stay accepted until you decide otherwise, so you cannot lock yourself
  out. The server keys are created on first start, unique to each
  computer.

Firewall: on by default, nftables, table "inet zeta". Every incoming
service is in one of three classes:
  LAN ONLY        local network only: name discovery (mDNS), ZETA Share,
                  SSH when turned on
  REMOTE ENABLED  also from the internet: SSH (on by default once
                  installed, off in the live session and the OVAs)
  DISABLED        everything else, dropped
Answers to connections you started, ping, DHCP and IPv6 always work.
Refused SSH attempts are logged (at most 3 a minute):
journalctl -k -g zeta-fw. Diagnosis of the whole path, from the network
card to sshd: sudo zeta-ssh diagnosi. Do not add rules with "nft add rule":
they are lost at the next restart. Extra rules go in a .nft file in
/etc/nftables.d/.

How the network is organised: one active firewall (nftables, table "inet
zeta", saved in /etc/nftables.conf) and one network manager (NetworkManager,
which also writes the DNS servers in /etc/resolv.conf). There is no
firewalld and no systemd-resolved. The iptables command is there, but it
writes into the same nftables. Instead of resolvectl: nmcli dev show (DNS in
use) and cat /etc/resolv.conf.

ufw is installed but OFF. If you prefer it, sudo ufw enable turns it on: it
then filters together with the ZETA firewall, and its rules for SSH (written
by zeta-ssh) and ZETA Share (local network only) are already there, so
nothing is cut off. sudo ufw status shows them.


9. TROUBLESHOOTING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wi-Fi says "password sbagliata" but you are sure it is right
  Check upper and lower case and the keyboard layout (the system uses the
  Italian layout). If it still fails, forget the network (bin button) and
  connect again. The full report: sudo zeta-diagnosi.

Wi-Fi says the access "non e' riuscito"
  The router did not complete the connection: move closer, or restart the
  router. If the network is hidden, use "Rete nascosta".

No Wi-Fi at all
  Settings > Wi-Fi e rete must show the Wi-Fi switch. If it does not, the
  card is not recognised: run "rfkill list" in the terminal (a "Hard blocked:
  yes" means a physical switch or a key on the laptop) and sudo zeta-diagnosi.

The first answer of ZETA is slow
  The local model is being loaded into memory, which takes a few seconds the
  first time; ZETA says so while it happens. With less than 8 GB of memory it
  is loaded again each time.

A program does not respond
  Ctrl + Alt + Esc, then click its window. Or Ctrl + Alt + Delete.

"grub rescue>" or the other system is missing from the boot menu
  Start from the ZETA RAYS USB stick, open the terminal and run:
      sudo zeta-ripara-avvio
  It finds the installed systems, shows what it is about to do, asks for
  confirmation, then reinstalls the boot loader and rebuilds the menu. It
  never touches partitions or data. It also fixes installations made with
  earlier 1.7 images, which hid the boot menu.

Cannot connect with SSH from another computer
  Run zeta-ssh stato: it says whether the server is on, whether port 22 is
  open and which address to use. sudo zeta-ssh diagnosi checks everything:
  network cards, routes, firewall, sshd, open connections, refused attempts.
  From the internet: on this computer run sudo tcpdump -ni any 'tcp port 22'
  and connect from outside. Nothing arrives: the router does not forward
  port 22. Only [S] arrives, no [S.] goes out: access from the internet is
  off (sudo zeta-ssh remoto attiva). In the live session and the OVAs the
  server is off: sudo zeta-ssh attiva. On the local network, from the other
  computer, nc -vz <address> 22 tells whether the port answers. A system
  installed with an earlier 1.7 image can be brought up to date with the
  script aggiorna-rete-zeta-rays.sh released with these
  images: sudo bash aggiorna-rete-zeta-rays.sh --prova analyses and checks
  without changing anything, then run it again without --prova. If SSH is
  already open from the internet there, it stays open (--solo-lan closes
  it, --remoto opens it).

Kernel panic at boot in a virtual machine (VMware Fusion, Workstation...)
  Fixed in these images: the boot no longer needs more memory than a small
  virtual machine has. VMware creates Linux machines with only 768 MB:
  give ZETA RAYS at least 4 GB of memory and turn on 3D acceleration
  (Display settings), otherwise the desktop is slow or falls back to the
  installer only.

No sound
  Settings > Audio: choose the right output device.

Anything else
  sudo zeta-diagnosi writes a full report (hardware, drivers, network,
  services, errors) that you can send to info@zetarays.org.


10. KNOWN LIMITATIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - The interface is in Italian. ZETA understands written commands in
    Italian; the voice also understands English.
  - Wi-Fi was tested with WPA2, WPA3 and mixed access points, 2.4 and 5 GHz,
    hidden networks and slow DHCP, using simulated radios. Each real card
    depends on its own driver: a few cards without a free driver (some
    Broadcom models) are not supported.
  - With WPA3, a wrong password and a router that does not answer look the
    same to the system: ZETA RAYS then says that the access did not succeed,
    instead of "password sbagliata".
  - Suspend, Bluetooth and the microphone depend on the hardware and were
    tested in virtual machines only.
  - The local model (Llama 3.2 1B) is small, so that it runs on modest
    computers: it is good for commands and short answers. For long or complex
    work, connect a bigger local model or an online service in Settings > AI.
  - Online AI services need your own key and a working internet connection.
  - Some images on web pages exist only inside the page ("blob" images):
    Firefox cannot hand them over by dragging. Right-click them and choose
    "Salva immagine con nome".
  - The ZETA Share window shows its own name, LocalSend.

12. PRIVACY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ZETA RAYS collects no data and sends no telemetry. The AI runs on your own
computer and does not send what you write to it over the network, unless you
choose an online AI service in Settings > AI: then what you write to ZETA goes
to that service, and to no one else. The only things that leave your computer
are the ones you ask for: package updates, pages you open in the browser,
searches you start.

The full detail is inside the system, under Settings > Information > Privacy.
